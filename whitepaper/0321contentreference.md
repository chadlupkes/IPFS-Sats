### 3.2.1. Content Reference

"content_cid": "QmOriginalContent..."

This is a direct link to the actual content stored in IPFS. By separating the metadata from the content itself, IPFS-Sats preserves content immutability—the raw file's CID never changes, enabling universal deduplication and verification.

**Why separate?**
- Multiple metadata objects can reference the same content (e.g., different licenses, translations)
- Content can be verified independently of IPFS-Sats
- Existing IPFS content can be "wrapped" retroactively

Traversal: Users can retrieve the content via IPFS path resolution: /ipfs/QmMetadata.../content_cid

However, the user gains no advantage by attempting a direct Content CID retrieval, because while they may not be the source of the payment (as the fee is covered by the Lightning Yield Wallet), they still lack the necessary authorization token generated by the IPFS Sats 0.2 traversal. The host node's protocol logic demands this token to ensure the transaction is recorded and the payout from the Yield Wallet is correctly triggered. Without the traversal, the file remains inaccessible.
