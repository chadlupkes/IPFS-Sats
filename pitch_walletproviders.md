## Pitch to Lightning Yield Wallet Providers (The Financial Backbone)

The IPFS Sats protocol has solved content persistence and access; we now require institutional capacity to manage the immense, high-frequency flow of value. We are seeking to integrate with leading Lightning Yield Wallet (LYW) Providers to establish the compliant, high-liquidity financial layer that makes the entire ecosystem operational. Your firm offers the critical services—channel management, institutional liquidity, and KYC/KYB compliance—that will securely bridge our decentralized content layer with the global financial system. This partnership is not just about routing payments; it is about establishing a foundational financial utility for the decentralized web, generating reliable yield on a scale never before seen in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The value proposition we offer is guaranteed, high-volume, and predictable micro-transaction flow. Unlike general Lightning routing which can be sporadic, the IPFS Sats protocol is designed to monetize content access at scale. Every single content stream, download, or licensed use across the entire network triggers an instant payment in Sats. The Archival DAO, our initial economic engine, will be a massive, consistent client requiring your inbound liquidity services to handle the continuous flow of millions of payments from content creators and institutional clients settling their fees. We guarantee a premium, high-frequency traffic source that transforms your locked BTC into an actively, profitably deployed asset.

We are seeking a deep partnership that goes beyond simple routing. We require API-level integration for automated channel management, on-demand liquidity services, and—crucially for our institutional Archival DAO clients—seamless conversion and settlement rails into fiat or stablecoins. Your expertise in managing non-custodial yield and ensuring regulatory compliance is essential to onboarding major studios, museums, and enterprise clients. By embedding your services directly into our protocol’s core payment logic, you become the primary liquidity provider for a content economy projected to scale globally.

This is a chance to secure long-term positioning as the leading financial utility for the next internet-scale infrastructure. Your partnership provides the high-capacity channels and compliance assurance needed to handle both the retail micropayments from Content Creators and the institutional settlements from the Archival DAO. You will be earning verifiable yield in Sats, secured by real-world content licensing activity, building a stable business rather than relying on speculative fees. We invite your team to review our transaction volume projections and discuss the strategic integration of your LYW services into the IPFS Sats protocol.
