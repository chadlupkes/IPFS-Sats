## Pitch to Content Creators (Songwriters)

Imagine you’ve just finished writing your next hit song. To get it to your audience, you must navigate a true labyrinth: submitting to labels, negotiating away masters and publishing rights, clearing the song with a Performance Rights Organization (PRO), then uploading to a digital distributor, who in turn lists it on various streaming platforms. At every step—from recording studio costs to distribution fees and administrative overhead—a piece of your potential revenue is taken. This complex, multi-layered bureaucracy means your work is filtered through a dozen middlemen, leaving you with minimal control, delayed payments, and an opaque view into who is listening and how much they are actually paying for your art.

The core challenge in the current system is proving ownership and processing payments without a central authority. As a songwriter, your creative rights are fractured into multiple streams—mechanical, performance, synchronization—each requiring a separate organization to track, license, and pay out royalties. This setup not only drastically slows down the payment cycle, often taking months for micropayments to accumulate and clear, but it also creates a massive transparency gap. You are forced to trust that the data from streaming giants and collecting societies is accurate, often receiving cents on the dollar for millions of plays while feeling powerless to verify the count or dispute the terms.

This is where the IPFS Sats 2.0 infrastructure steps in to collapse the labyrinth. Using this new protocol, a songwriter would bypass virtually all the traditional middlemen. When your song is finished, you simply use the protocol to register the work. The song file itself and its associated metadata (artist, title, licensing terms, price per stream/download) are instantly pinned to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), creating an immutable, distributed, and instantly verifiable record of your creation. This single action is your proof of creation, distribution, and rights management, all rolled into one.

The powerful shift happens with monetization through Sats (Satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin). Instead of waiting six months for a bank transfer from a distributor, every interaction—every stream, download, or licensed use—triggers an instant, transparent micro-payment directly from the listener or licensee to your digital wallet. The song’s metadata contains the smart contract that dictates the royalty splits, ensuring your collaborators are paid instantly, too. With IPFS Sats, you retain 100% ownership, control your licensing terms, and turn a slow, opaque revenue stream into a real-time, peer-to-peer flow of value that cuts out the administrative overhead, putting the vast majority of the revenue directly into the hands of the creator.

We believe this infrastructure is the future of content ownership and monetization. It is built to restore control and maximize value for creators like you. We are currently seeking feedback from forward-thinking artists to ensure the protocol addresses real-world challenges. We would love for you to review a draft of the IPFS Sats White Paper and share your perspective on how this system could transform your songwriting career.
