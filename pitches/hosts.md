## Pitch to Node Operators and Infrastructure Providers (Universal Participation Model)

The IPFS Sats 2.0 vision is one of 100% participation: a content network scaled to be run by every user, from the individual running a single device 24/7, all the way up to the cloud servers of tomorrow in orbital stations. We are seeking individuals and companies ready to host the content and route the payments that will power this universal architecture. Your machine, whether a low-power home server or a vast data center, is the critical infrastructure needed to secure global content and usher in a new wealth paradigm based on decentralized utility.

The IPFS Sats protocol is engineered for radical accessibility. We need two kinds of service providers, and our system is designed to reward both equally based on performance, not size. For Content Persistence (IPFS), every device can earn by guaranteeing content permanence. While the Archival DAO provides massive, high-value pinning contracts (e.g., museum archives), these contracts are deliberately distributed across a network of diverse node sizes. This means a small, reliable personal computer providing a secure persistence service can earn verifiable Sats-denominated revenue for storage and bandwidth, just as a larger data center does, making your idle capacity an active asset in the decentralized economy.

For Payment Routing (Lightning), the high volume of content micropayments ensures profitability for nodes of any scale. Every single interaction—a stream from a mobile phone app, a licensed use by a corporation—triggers an instant Sat payment. This decentralized, massive volume of micro-transactions means that a well-connected, high-uptime personal Lightning Node can efficiently route traffic and earn substantial Sats routing fees, bypassing the need for huge liquidity pools. Your contribution to the network’s channel diversity and capacity is essential for delivering instant value transfer from any user, anywhere in the world.

We are calling on the global community of operators—from the enthusiast running a dedicated home node to established service giants—to join this ecosystem. The IPFS Sats system ensures you are paid in the world’s most secure currency, Sats, for providing fundamental, verifiable utility to a network designed for everyone. By running a node, you are not merely hosting data; you are actively contributing to the new wealth paradigm where participation, not centralization, defines success. Start positioning your personal computer or server farm today to be the earning engine of the future internet.
