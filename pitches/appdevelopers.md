## Pitch to Application Developers and Ecosystem Builders (The Gold Rush)

The IPFS Sats 2.0 protocol provides the pipes and the money; we need visionaries to build the future of the internet on top of it. We have engineered the most secure and sustainable backend for content imaginable—a censorship-resistant layer powered by IPFS and a built-in, instant monetization rail using Sats. However, a protocol is just a foundation. We are now actively recruiting the front-end innovators—the Application Developers and UX/UI pioneers—who will use our open APIs to build the decentralized applications that will onboard the next billion users. This is your chance to lead the new application layer and capture first-mover advantage.

We understand that building a decentralized app (dApp) is challenging, which is why the IPFS Sats protocol is designed to eliminate the two biggest friction points for you: Content Sourcing and Monetization. The protocol provides a clean, unified API to access all content secured by the Archival DAO and all content published by individual creators—an immediate, rich pool of legally accessible data. Furthermore, the complexity of payments is handled natively by our integration with Lightning Layer 2. You don’t worry about processing fees or bank compliance; you simply build the interface, and the revenue flows directly to your users' wallets in Sats.

The commercial opportunity here is clear: you are building the dApps for the new wealth paradigm. Imagine creating a music platform where the artist gets paid in Sats per second of playback, or a photo-sharing app where the user is paid Sats for the bandwidth they contribute. Every application you build on our protocol is instantly integrated into a transparent, audit-proof economy where the value flow is guaranteed. We are creating a gold rush where the value accrues to the service providers and innovators, not the centralized platform owners.

To accelerate the launch of your applications, the Content DAO will be dedicating a significant portion of its early funding—generated by the Archival DAO’s revenue—to Ecosystem Grants and Developer Bounties. These grants are non-dilutive, paid in Sats, and designed to fund your initial build, feature development, and UX testing. We are not just giving you tools; we are giving you seed capital and a guaranteed user base (Content Creators and Node Operators) already incentivized to use your apps. If you are ready to abstract away the crypto complexity and build the first genuinely decentralized, user-friendly killer apps, we invite you to review our SDK and apply for an initial development grant.
