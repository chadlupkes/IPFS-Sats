## Pitch to Strategic Investors (The Archival DAO)

The IPFS Sats 2.0 protocol is a paradigm shift: it secures global content by pairing the decentralized resilience of IPFS with the verifiable, sound money of Bitcoin (Sats) via Layer 2 solutions. We are not offering a speculative token; we are offering a direct, asset-backed investment in core internet infrastructure. The central challenge today is not just building the protocol, but populating it with valuable, secure data. Our immediate investment opportunity is focused on launching the Archival DAO, a cash-flow generating entity designed to bring high-value, existing cultural and institutional content—from museum archives to major studio back catalogs—into the IPFS Sats ecosystem, securing global knowledge for the Bitcoin age.

The Archival DAO serves as the initial economic engine for the entire IPFS Sats protocol. Its mandate is to acquire licensing and distribution rights, manage the guaranteed persistence of these massive datasets on IPFS, and facilitate their micropayment monetization using the protocol. This essential service—guaranteed archival permanence and seamless, instant monetization—becomes a high-margin, scalable business. Studios, museums, and governments will pay a recurring fee (in Sats) to the Archival DAO for this persistent hosting and rights management, creating a reliable, foundational revenue stream that is automatically collected via an associated Lightning Yield Wallet (LYW).

Your investment is tracked with precision through a custom, non-fungible contract receipt issued on a Bitcoin sidechain or secure ledger. This receipt cryptographically represents your contributed principal in Sats. Critically, the investment structure prioritizes the return of capital first: 100% of your initial Sats contribution will be paid back directly from the operational revenue generated by the Archival DAO’s content licensing and LYW routing fees. Once the initial principal is fully returned, the receipt automatically converts into an evergreen revenue-sharing contract, entitling you to a pre-agreed percentage of the Archival DAO's net operating revenue—paid instantly and continuously in Sats.

This model allows investors to participate in a foundational infrastructure play without exposure to speculative token volatility. You are investing directly into a transparently managed entity—the Archival DAO—that generates real-world revenue by solving a critical problem for institutions globally: digital permanence and sovereign ownership. The success of the Archival DAO is designed to self-fund the development of the core IPFS Sats 2.0 protocol itself, turning capital contribution into sustainable protocol development. We invite you to review the detailed financial modeling and Archival DAO structure and join us in building the permanent content layer of the internet.
