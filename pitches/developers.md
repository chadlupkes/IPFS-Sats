## Pitch to Protocol Developers (Sats-Focused Infrastructure)

We are seeking foundational engineers to build the economic backbone of a decentralized internet, anchored not on vaporware, but on the world’s most secure monetary system. The IPFS Sats 2.0 protocol is not launching a new token or ICO; we are strictly focused on coupling the immutable content storage of IPFS with the instant, peer-to-peer micro-payments enabled by Sats (Bitcoin Layer 2). Our challenge is to abstract away the complexity of centralized distribution, allowing content creators to register, distribute, and monetize their work instantly and transparently, all while transacting directly on the Bitcoin monetary layer. This is an opportunity to contribute core code to a system designed to be by and for Bitcoin and the world, ensuring censorship-resistance for global creative output.

The technical scope of work requires expertise in high-performance, resilient protocol engineering. We need architects for the Lightning Network Integration Stack—creating the wallet and transaction modules that can securely process millions of fractional Sat payments upon content access, interfacing with established Lightning Yield Wallet providers to ensure instant settlement. Concurrently, expertise is required in Distributed Systems and IPFS Optimization to build custom content discovery layers, prioritizing low latency and maximum throughput. Finally, we need developers to define the Metadata and Licensing Contracts, creating the standardized, immutable schemas that link a verified content hash to the designated payout addresses, managing licensing and revenue splits directly in the underlying protocol logic.

This is fundamentally a question of digital sovereignty and scalability. We are building a truly open and non-extractive infrastructure that is designed to be as secure and permanent as Bitcoin itself. The engineering task involves solving complex problems in verifiable content access, managing global state without centralization, and maintaining ultra-low fee economics through Layer 2 solutions. If you are passionate about pushing the boundaries of what is possible when robust cryptography meets sound money, and if your goal is to build long-term, foundational code that will serve the global population for decades, this is your call to action.

To maintain purity and focus, our compensation model reflects our commitment to Bitcoin. There is no IPFS Sats protocol token. Instead, all contributions and investments are managed through a transparent Content DAO, which functions as the protocol’s public treasury. Core contributors are compensated directly in Sats (BTC) via the Lightning Network upon the successful completion of verifiable code milestones. This model ensures you are paid in the most liquid, secure, and universally valued currency for your work, free from the speculation and regulatory overhead of launching a new asset. You gain credit as a foundational architect of a protocol poised to decentralize the $2 trillion digital media industry, paid entirely in the hardest money available. We invite you to review the white paper and help us define the roadmap for IPFS Sats 2.0.
